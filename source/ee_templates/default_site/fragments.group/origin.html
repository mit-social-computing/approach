<p>The path to starting a school was not a straight one.  Prior to having a child, I had never considered it.  And even after my son was born, I had a number of disconnected ideas around how I wished the world would be, but it wasn’t obvious to me, until recently, how to address these ideas.</p>  

<p>When my son was born, I remember thinking how strange it was that I had trained for nine years to be a professor.  But my training for fatherhood -- a job more consequential -- consisted of reading a few books.</p>

<p>I further remember how difficult it was for me to go back to work after my paternity leave.  I love my work and am nourished by it, but it was unsettling for me to go from being with my son all day every day, to seeing him two to three hours a day on weekdays.</p>

<p>When my son was a year and a half, I had a meeting in Santa Cruz.  The person giving me a ride pointed out a number of empty parks on the way from the airport and said: “When I was growing up, all these parks used to be full of kids.  Now, they’re empty.  These days, neighbors don’t know each other.”</p>

<p>When it came time to thinking about preschool, I took on the job of researching the options in the area.  I looked at a number of schools, and I was really struck by the Montessori schools.  The children were so peaceful, so focused, so independent, and so interdependent.  I became intrigued and read every book on Montessori that I could get my hands on, and started to take my son to a parent-child Montessori class in the South End.  In doing so, I was both impressed by the thoughtfulness and brilliance of Maria Montessori, and surprised at how little research has been done to extend the Montessori Method in the half-century since her passing.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I started thinking about starting a school.  I wanted to send my son to a school that would allow me to spend time with him at school and that would take the teaching of parents as a central aim.  I wanted the parents whose children were enrolled to serve as co-creators of the school rather than just customers.  I hoped that the time the families would spend together in the school would serve to foster a local community that would be supportive to the children and parents alike.  I wanted an authentic Montessori school, but also a lab school where research could be done to extend the Montessori Method for the modern world and for the benefit of others.  And I wanted the school to be adaptive, both to the learnings of the research and the unique needs of the children and families attending.</p>  

<p>In order to make all of this work, it made sense for the school to be small.  A one-room school could more easily be responsive to its small number of families, could more easily support new ideas and experiments, and could more easily integrate the learnings from the research being done.  The reduced administrative overhead would give the teachers more autonomy and allow us to spend more resources and attention on the children rather than on managing a large-scale operation.  Having spent some time in the startup world, I had a good sense of how nimble and effective small organizations could be.</p>  

<p>In May of last year, a friend of mine let me know that a space was up for rent in the neighborhood.  I went to look at the space, and it was beautiful, well-located, and the right size.  I realized that if I didn’t rent this space, I would never start a school.  So I rented it.  I then called a lawyer with whom I had done some work in the past, and asked him if he’d take me on as a pro-bono client, and we incorporated Wildflower Montessori School in June.</p>

<p>Because I had visited every Montessori school in the area when looking at schools for my son, I knew the landscape well.  The head of school who I was most impressed with was Mary Rockett, who was the head of Walnut Park Montessori at the time I visited.  She had a wonderful way about her and a deep-seated knowledge of Montessori that comes only through years of practice.  I approached her about being the head of school and lead teacher at Wildflower, and after a few weeks of conversations, she agreed.</p>

<p>I also reached out to Catherine McTamaney, the author of the book on Montessori that resonated the most with me, a book called The Tao of Montessori.  Her book emanated insight and compassion, and as I got the chance to get to know her, I felt her bring those same qualities to each of our meetings.  After a series of conversations, she also agreed to come on board.</p>

<p>And finally, in the fall we put out an ad for an assistant head of school.  To my delight, Katelyn Ryan -- whom I knew from Cambridge Montessori where she was the head of primary programs, and a lead teacher for 7 years before that -- responded.  Mary and I met with her to discuss the position, and when she left the meeting, we looked at each other and both said at the same time: “We are so lucky.”</p>

<p>There was so much interest in the first school, that the natural next step was to open-source the model and help others to create more schools that share the Wildflower principles.  The people who are now heads of these schools, Castle O'Neill, Katie Tremblay, Misse Carolan, Angelina Hawley-Dolan, and Marcia Hubelbank, are truly wonderful people, both in terms of their capabilities, their insights, and their loving spirit.</p>  

<p>This group, along with the members of my lab who are working on learning-related research -- Kim Smith, Kim Holleman, Yonatan Cohen, Nazmus Saquib, Gloria Mark, Noah Wall, and Brian Whitton -- as well as the families who serve as co-creators of each of these schools, constitute a dream team.  I consider myself profoundly lucky to get to interact with and learn from such a talented and kind-hearted group of people.</p>

<p>Our mission, from the beginning, has been create a model that other people can take and evolve in a way that makes sense to them.  We provide our materials and our learnings free and open-source, and commit to continuing to do so.  We hope that you will feel free to make use of them, and build upon them, as you wish.  It is only in this way, as an open-source, community project, that the impact of this experiment will stay true to its founding spirit and reach its full potential.  We truly hope that you will join us in this journey.</p>  

<p>With gratitude,</p>
